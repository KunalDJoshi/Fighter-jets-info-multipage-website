<h2>Overview</h2>
</div>
<div id="p-overview">
A fighter jet is a military aircraft primarily designed for air-to-air combat whose main mission is to secure airspace of the nation. Since World War 1, fighter jets
have played an important role in achieving and maintaining air superiority and to gain victory in conventional warfare. Early fighter jets were very small and lightly armed
primarily designed to gather information by reconnaissance over the battlefield. By World War 2, most fighter jets were metal monoplanes armed with machine guns having
single or twin-engine. During 1950s, radar was fitted to day fighters, since due to ever increasing air-to-air weapon ranges, pilots could no longer see far enough 
ahead to prepare for opposition. Since development of earlier fighter jets, they are broadly categorized into five generations. Each generation represents a certain class of
technology used in the planes: avionics, construction, engines, etc. Higher generation means a more technologically advanced fighter jet.

<div id="info1">
The Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor is a fifth-generation, single-seat, twin-engine, all-weather stealth tactical fighter aircraft developed for the United States Air Force (USAF). 
It is the first operational aircraft to combine super cruise, super maneuverability, stealth, and sensor fusion in a single weapons platform. Lockheed Martin Aeronautics was the
prime contractor, built most of the F-22's airframe and weapons systems and conducted final assembly, while Boeing provided the wings, aft fuselage, avionics integration, and 
training systems. The F-22 was designed to be highly difficult to detect and track by radar. It is the most advanced and most expensive production fighter aircraft to date. 
This advanced aircraft was adopted in 2003. It was never offered for export customers, even other allies and NATO countries.

<div id="info2">
The Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II is a family of single-seat, single-engine, all-weather, stealth, fifth-generation, multirole combat aircraft, designed for ground-attack 
and air-superiority missions. The F-35 was developed under a Joint Strike Fighter program, which was intended to replace existing aircraft types with a common fighter. The F-35
has a configuration similar to that of Lockheed Martin's own F-22 design, however it is slightly smaller and has one engine instead of two. It exploits stealth technology, which 
reduces its radar cross-section and makes it harder to detect. The F-35 first flew on 15 December 2006. The F-35A is armed with a GAU-22/A, a four-barrel version of the 25 mm 
GAU-12 Equalizer cannon.

<div id="info3">
The Sukhoi Su-57 is a stealth, single-seat, twin-engine multirole fifth-generation jet fighter being developed since 2002. The Su-57 is considered as first aircraft in Russian 
military service to use stealth technology. The fighter jet is designed to have super cruise, super maneuverability, stealth, and advanced avionics to overcome the prior generation 
fighter aircraft as well as ground and naval defense. The Su-57 has succeed the MiG-29 and Su-27 in the Russian Air Force. Despite being referred as a fifth-generation fighter, 
there are some serious doubts about it, as some US Military officials referred the Sukhoi PAK FA only as advanced fourth-generation fighter. Two large internal weapon bays are mounted 
in tandem between the engines. This fighter has 10 internal and 6 external hardpoints for various air-to-air, air-to-surface, anti-radiation missiles and even guided bombs.

<div id="info4">
The Boeing F/A-18E and F/A-18F Super Hornet are twin-engine, carrier-capable, multirole fighter aircraft variants based on the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet. The Super Hornet is 
an evolutionary redesign of the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet. It has an internal 20 mm M61 rotary cannon and can carry air-to-air missiles and air-to-surface weapons. The Super 
Hornet was first ordered by the U.S. Navy in 1992. The Super Hornet first flew on 29 November 1995. Survivability is an important feature of the Super Hornet design. Avionics of 
Super Hornet includes an up-front Touchscreen control display, a large multipurpose color LCD and a fuel display. Some common operators of Super Hornet include United States Navy, 
Royal Australian Air Force, Kuwait Air Force.

The Eurofighter Typhoon is a twin-engine, canardâ€“delta wing, multirole fighter. It is manufactured by Eurofighter Jagdflugzeug GmbH. The Typhoon was designed originally as an air 
superiority fighter. It has a quadruplex digital fly-by-wire control system providing artificial stability. Although not designed as a stealth fighter, measures were taken to reduce
the Typhoon's radar cross section, especially from the frontal aspect. The Typhoon features a glass cockpit without any conventional instruments. The Typhoon has GPS and an inertial 
navigation system for navigation. It can use Instrument Landing System for landing in poor weather. The Eurofighter Typhoon is fitted with two Eurojet EJ200 engines. It is a multi-role
fighter with maturing air-to-ground capabilities.

The Dassault Rafale is a French twin-engine, canard delta wing, multirole fighter aircraft. It is designed and built by Dassault Aviation. Equipped with a wide range of weapons, the 
Rafale is intended to perform air supremacy, interdiction, aerial reconnaissance, ground support, in-depth strike, anti-ship strike and nuclear deterrence missions. Although not a 
full-aspect stealth aircraft, the Rafale was designed for a reduced radar cross-section and infrared signature. The Rafale core avionics systems employ an integrated modular avionics, 
called modular data processing unit. This architecture hosts all the main aircraft functions such as the flight management system, data fusion, fire control, and the man-machine interface.
The Rafale is fitted with two Snecma M88 engines.

The Sukhoi Su-35 is single-seat, twin-engine, supermaneuverable aircraft. It is designed by the Sukhoi Design Bureau and built by the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Plant. It is the 
designation for two improved derivatives of the Su-27 air-defense fighter. The Su-35 is powered by a pair of Saturn AL-41F1S engine. Developers refer the Su-35 as 4++ generation fighter. 
It is a very fast and highly maneuverable fighter with very long range, high altitude capability and heavy armament. The Su-35 is primarily an air superiority fighter. However, it has 
secondary air-to-ground capability. Its large and powerful engines give it ability to super cruise for a long time. Also, its engines allow to reach supersonic speeds without using an afterburner.
Potential operators include Russia, United Arab Emirates, India, Egypt.
